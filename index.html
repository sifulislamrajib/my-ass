                    <p>It all started when my grandparents purchased their first computer. Being as this was the first computer I had ever used, I did not know how to use it very well.</p>

                    <p>TI mostly used it for games, which my grandma would set up for me to play. I also drew pictures with the computer's paint program, the functionality of which, unfortunately, was very limited. The relatively new computer industry's technology could not produce enough colors to portray very realistic pictures.</p>

                    <p>After using the new computer for a few years, I sent a picture I had created to my uncles who work with 3D imaging. They were impressed, and asked me if I would like a professional imaging program.</p>
